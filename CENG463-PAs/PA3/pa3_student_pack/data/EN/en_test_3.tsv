Other	@unhealthytruth No.  The slap was real.  But this is not only staged but planned by Hollywood and the media to take attention away from this country’s problems: Biden, inflation, gas, the war.  Media will talk about it for weeks.  The biggest “SQUIRREL “ of all time by Hollywood and the media.
