Seems super irresponsible to me.
False	@DrHannahGale @iamgregk We now know the spike itself is cytotoxic, if the injection remained at the arm muscle the impact would be limited. If spread throughout the circulatory system different story. The impact on mutation of the virus due to mass vaccination was also raised during its development.

True	"@OurPlanet2024 @boofyre @Clover_Lace @ArmedfceSndwich @CNBC @CNBCMakeIt I'm super pro vaccine! It reduces severity significantly.
