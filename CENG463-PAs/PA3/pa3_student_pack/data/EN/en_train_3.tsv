False	@Dan_Marchais @mtracey There is a genocide in Ukraine. Waged by Ukrainian Gov for the last 8 years against Russian speaking people of the Donbas region. Killing over 14k people. But I also doubt that's what she is talking about. Maybe because US supports them both (Ukraine and Yemen).

True	@donrafa_jr @eugene_finkel Probably the side that was invaded, has millions of refugees and tens of thousands of civilian casualties.  The Russians can't make a serious claim of genocide.

True	"@HepChimp @anarchistCC @Angel14255190 @InfraHaz I'm not claiming the war in the Donbas didn't happen. I'm saying that not every war crime constitutes genocide. Claiming everything is genocide is generally a liberal tactic aimed to justify imperialism.
