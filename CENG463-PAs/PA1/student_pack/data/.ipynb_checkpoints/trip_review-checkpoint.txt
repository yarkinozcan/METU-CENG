Really overpriced and actually nothing more than the caves you can see for free outside of the museum. Most churches were closed anyways and to the special ones you have to again pay a fee even tho you already paid an entry fee to the museum. They also removed all information signs about the caves so that you will buy an additional audio guide. At the entry there are many guide molesting you trying to deceive you into a tour.
