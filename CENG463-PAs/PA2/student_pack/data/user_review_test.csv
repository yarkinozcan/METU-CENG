0,"I am using this product from last 37 days it is a pathetic phone with issue of display from day one and around 2 days back more problems aroused the phone suddenly get discharged at 50% and gets switched off also on recharging it does not recharges, Please keep yourself away from this junk of a product i am conned and does not want you all to be conned, also at service center they will only format your phone and update software in spite of you complaining of the display problem, i am facing the problem since last 37 days but for them the problem does not exist what a joke and fooling tricks these guys are trained for,Lenovo has made a junk and no other word fits better and above that the service team is a con stars employed just to fool the buyers so please resist yourself and buy anyother product instead my suggestion.Highly upset with the whole experience"

0,Mobile is good.. having too many featuresAnd have some problems also... Like gallery is not there in mobile... You have to see all you stuff.. like videos and photos in Google photos....And not for headphones lover.. very low sound in headphones....And micro SD card doesn't support properly..After copying songs from mobile to SD card...player will not support those songs....Not a value for money mobile...Lenovo will never able to make mobile like k4 note....
0,"Screen cast does not work, and when complained to lenovo, suggested to buy a chrome cast and use the screen cast, which I suggest to add a patch in android make it work directly as i was happy to use Lenovo K5 note and its screen cast.Also i do not see any significant change in 400 AH battery Vs 3500 MAH battery in K5 note. suggest for improving the same.Torch light is natural which is yellowish in nature, is the LED designed such way or is their any issue as same light appears whiter when it works as flash, while taking a photo"
0,Cheap n bad performance. I m totally disappointed from this. Second camera is only a lollipop.
0,To vorest product don't purchase this mobile
0,mobile battery not good
0,Bad product...Poor camera quality.Installed softwares are poor.Heat too much.One speaker of my ordered mobile is not working.
0,Horrable performance with VoLTE sim card. Poor coverage and always give message of switch off to remote person who is calling. So.many bugs in VoLTE software.Camera quality is not as per expectations what Lenovo is claiming in advertisements. Camera response also very slow.Depth mode is givien in camera but useless as after taking snap you have to edit photo and editing tool is also poor. Audio quality is average. Not satisfied. Not worth of money. Better handsets are available in same price.

0,I want return
0,"I am posting this review after a week of usage.First of all lots of people problem is to go with this one or Redmi note 4 . So I have used both the device . The only difference between this one and rn4 is battery backup . You'll get around 8 hours of sot in rn4 but only around 5 to 6 hours in k8 note.Other than that all the aspects are definitely better in k8 note. And there is also fast charging in this one which charges fully in 2 hours without using the device if you are using then definitely charging will be much slower.If we consider k8 note alonePros areDual camera (If only there is an update in future to improve)Fast chargingDisplay (All mobiles in this price segment maybe fhd. But this one is slightly better)Dolby AtmosStock Android Superb fluidity (Definitely Lenovo done a great job by removing their ui and goes with stock)Theatre max ( If u are person who is watching lots of Hollywood movies this is best feature)Cons areI experiencing Heating issue while charging and playing (But not too much I think it's manageable)Difference in battery backup ( sometimes I'm getting 6 hours of sot and sometimes around 4 to 5 hours ..But I suggest you to install Greenify for more better battery backup)Unwanted second camera if there is no further updates for cameraThose are the cons I found till nowFinally there are the problems like camera and battery but those can be solved via OTA so I am eagerly waiting for updates.For 14k I'll definitely suggest this one over rn4 , Moto g5 plus and Honor 6x.Im disappointed now that is more than a month no proper update for camera and battery backup is getting worse...so i suggest u guys to ignore this one"

Sound is good ,Back camera is good after OTA update front camera is average. Battery survives through the day and charges to 100% in about one and a half hour. The major issue which I faced was network issues for the incoming calls . For which have to return the phone to Amazon else the phone was good . Probably that defect might have been only on my handset. Anyways getting the refund so not much of worry ."

0,Great phone(with first it's was the battery issue and with the replacement well it didn't even starred)With the dirt I was having an issue with the battery as when it reaches 15%It's goes to zero within 1 or 2 minutes straight.Happening continuesly thoughAnd now the replacement phone wellIt didn't even started its just like a brick.It's all due to bad seller which makes amazon looks even worseWhy can't you deliver a product which works just fine..... seller made my new year

0,Lenovo needs to maintain a standard key structure...I just upgraded from k4 to k8 ..and found that the back soft key (traingular) was located on the left side while in k4 the same is located on the right which was easy and comfortable for a right-hander to go back ...
0,Heating to much
0,1 thing it has 4000 mah battery but it don't give battery backup as I expected on the basic of it's review2 this phone not keep long life battery backup as like you said 376 hours it contain only 26- 30 hours onlyIt seems like local phone not equipped with design and internal design
0,Device was delivered to me on 16th sept and with in a span of one week it had issue of restarting again and again while in usage (in idle too). Approached the service center with the same... they took 4 days of time and returned me back saying there wont be further issues but in less than two days of their service mobile started behaving the same... still the mobile is in service center....Finally my suggestion...Before making a decision of buying a Motorola / lenovo mobile please visit their service center near by. By seeing the number of people carrying their new mobiles.. you can come to conclusion that its waste of money first then waste of time approaching them.

0,"This phone really is a killer, it will kill you with frustration.1.Constant heating during game play/call/ or video.2. Battery drains very fast, even handsets with 3000mah battery lasts longer than this phone.3. Picture quality gets lower in depth mode.4. Networks goes to 'no service' mode very frequently. once the network is gone, the only way to get connected is to restart.5. signal strength is less, compared with other device at the same place.6. during the low battery the performance is really slow, a normal news app opens up 2-3 sec after tapping.7. Charging is really slow, charges only 30-40% in an hour."
0,"Bought it because of 64GB + other benefits but disappointed now. It's been just a month and requested for a replacement of Turbo charger by wasting a whole day in their service centre. Not sure what standards they follow. Quite disappointed. Not recommended to buy. As lot of good things like 64 GB, camera features. The charge does not last for the day."

0,"Amazon Packing was appreciable as usual.Disappointed for delivery time even paid prime member it took 6 day to arrive.I have been decided to purchase Nokia6 then sudden launch of K8 , revert my decision ...So that bought this device .But after getting this device I am really very disappointed .*Front and rear camera quality does decent job on daylight (but you need to hold camera after click 😑) but sucks in low light.No use of front and back flash both cause noisy image .*When try both front and rearcamera under room light OMG very bad camera quality even you yuphoria 8MP camera beat it.*Don't know Why Lenovo fix dual camera in this device...3rd class depth of field (portrait mode)Coolpad cool1 did better job.*I think Snapdragon 430 of Nokia will be slower than Decacore MT x23... But realised why ppl not happy with media take procccessor :(It takes too much time to process image even holding it up After click.*Battery does decent job 👍lasts upto 8 hrs, but charging was pathetic tooks more than 2.5 hr (when do not use phone)pros:-Thank to Nougat stock Androidoleophobic ,coating ,2.5 D , corning gorilla glassLet's see what Lenovo will be doing?

0,Good productVery nice camera .Sound is awesome.Only one problem.Guys please update ur software and u will get led notification and battery percentage showing in this product.
0,Phone overheats way too quick. 4000 mAh battery barely stays 2-3 of gaming. I used Redmi note 5 pro before this. Same 4000 mAh battery but Note 5 can handle 5-6 hours of gaming easily. Lastly turbo charging is joke; 10% - 100% in 2 hours 30 mins most of the time.
0,"It's heat up when you charge the phone or watching movies, battery drain fast. It's support quick charge but if you use Wi-Fi then definitely two or more times must be require to charge the phone."

0,Automatic crack to display in the mobile
0,"Not satisfied by this phone. Not as per expectations.- Heats a lot (curtosy: Mediatek processor)- battery life isn't great (doesn't even last a complete day on average usage, keeps draining quickly even on standby - I don't have many power intensive apps)- not very ergnomic to hold. The corners are very sharp.- camera is ok-ok. Dual camera (depth mode) isn't precise. While recording videos, I have noticed the lens is focusing multiple times.. and as a result it keeps blurring and focusing giving a poor outcome video when u see the video again later.- visibility under sunlight is not that great. Brightness is generally less. If u increase brightness means it consumes more power.- takes a long long time to charge. Wonder why they call turbo charging.- I noticed some issue with my handset, not sure if it's common across Lenovo K8 note. Although there are 2 speakers, left ones is very weak. The right speaker is strong and loud.I wouldn't recommend this phone, especially when there are good phones in price bracket. Moto g5s plus is much better choice - even if it means spending few bucks extra."
0,"I am writing this review after 7 months of usageIn the package: Mobile, turbo charging adapter, USB Cable, plastic case, normal screen guard, sim ejector toolCamera: Good for photos and videos in this pricing segment for daylight images. Struggles when it comes to night photography. Slow motion video recording is defiantly not up to the mark.OS: Got the system update, Lenovo keeps sending the software updates time to time. Despite keeping the software of the phone up to date the performance of the phone is not up to the mark> Phone & contacts (both are default) apps doesn't work some times takes 30 to 40 sec to load the screen> Any app be it Facebook, Instagram etc., handgs once in a day due to phone performance issues (what is the point of having 4 GB ram)> Heating issue when playing heavy games like Asphalt 8 and the app hangs giving worst gaming experienceBattery:4000 mAh battery, takes 3 hours to charge from 0% to 100% with the turbo charger provided. If you are a heavy user battery comes for 6 to 8 hours else it might come for 12 hours at max.Phone speaker: Not loud enough while playing music out, also while in traffic you can't hear the calls, absolutely not even a single word. Speaker sucks"

0,"I got it delivered on 19th February 2018. With in 71 days of purchase, by May 1st, the Battery started showing complaint.Every Morning, from 6 am, I charge it to 100%. The charging was very fast, with in 2-3 hrs, it was getting fully charged.I start to use it by 8:00 am. Usual usage like phone, whatsapp and fb. By 9:30 I reach office, after that, Net usage only 10 mins average per hour. Calls 2-3 mins average per hour.But the phone gets drained off to 0% by 1 pm.This was going on from May 1st to May 15th.From May 15th Tuesday, it takes more than 8 Hrs for charging.Now, this is not a phone, mobile phone or smart phone. I have to keep it in charging all the time. Evenings and Travel are a night mare.You can imagine the feeling of a charge less phone in hand.The issue with customer service station is that, they work till evening 6 pm.

(Not as loud and clear as K4 Note and Vibe X3 with earphones). Not suited for music enthusiasts at all.Stock Android 7.1 version is rugged and not so user friendly. Too many settings are replaced and are annoying to navigate through.Overall, a decent phone at great price considering the hardware package being offered."

0,Battery is taking 4 hours to charge and getting drain in 6 hours. Not something good for buying.Also Amazon has a cheating policy now a days for return and refund. They are asking for some local app to check the phone. Which doesn't have battery checking option.

Some futures are not there.4. Notification lite blinks only for Normal messages, calls, mail, It is not blinking for WhatsApp, FB messenger etc....any other app notifications.  > I am expecting (main status bar features)that some of the features are I mentioned above will give in next andriod version.Good:1.

0,"I bought this because of the value for the money and the brand. I am using this since a week the performance is ok, camera quality, sound, screen, and the features are quite good. The drawback of the phone is it's getting warm when I put it for charging even when I connect it for internet. It's a just a week old product and I just started using it regular since few days. That's something discouraging to suggest others to buy this"
0,I brought this product at Diwali offer.Mobile is looks quiet good.13 MP Camera front + 13+5 MP Camera at back. Result of front camera is ok/ggod in day light but not 13 MP wala good at night. Rear camera waste.Played Need for speed No limits and game is running ok bug lags sometimes and graphics are worse.Looks nice.I have problem with screen guard I haven't find the exact due to curved screen at the edges.Overall performance is good.It is mentioned that it comes with 15W charger but it has normal charger with 6Ams

0,"I bought this one at the first flash sell. Here is my review after using this for a long time:Pros:-Dedicated mmc slot-A configurable hardware key-Dolby sound enhancement-Powerful CPU-Front camera is really good+Front flash-Compass sensor (This was a deciding factor for me)-Stock android (This could be both advantage as well as disadvantage. Its good for those who wants simple phone and the advanced users who need root etc. Those who wants great readymade ui features, don't go for stock android. I am a root user but the problem is official kernel source not available)-A gesture which lowers ringing volume when u pick up the phone-Fast fingerprint sensorCons:-Dual rear camera is a total crap. It can't detect edges properly-No 4K recording and time lapse which you should expect at this price range-Have tones of software bugs (ex- display brightness flickering while watching YouTube for a long time)-Notification LED only works with Missed call, sms and Gmail app-Battery backup isn't good-Have heating issue-Build quality: The phone is heavyweight. I can't use vr headset more than 30 min. Primary lense is getting dust easily. I have to clean it every 2 months.-Lenovo's ota update: Lenovo is superslow in providing ota updates. Users have reported all the bugs present in the phone. Though Lenovo isn't taking actions.So, if you need a dedicated sd slot+compass sensor, then go for it. Otherwise there is no reason to buy this phone."
0,I'm using this review after using 15 days..Overall Mobile is good . Battery is good compare to other handsets...Major problem..4G network not supported . You can use any 4g sim jio airtel idea major networks . Network doesn't supported full coverage outdoor and indoor ...Already visiting lenovo store they are confirmed lenovo Android issue

0,I have been using this product since a month....Previously I was Moto g2 .....Major fault that I observed was audio clarity is slightly degraded in earphones but speakers are good....I found this because I'm using both g2 and k8 note.....SO if music is top priority choose a another one.....if not u can go for it
0,Battery of this phone is pathetic. After using for 3 weeks it's now giving me problems with charging time. Now I can't return the product as return window is closed. And Lenovo customer services are the worst.
0,Worst phone.. hanging at an starting stage don't buy Lenovo company itself

0,I received a defective piece or problem in Lenovo I don't... I have purchased Lenovo k8 plus model no Lenovo k8 plus (XT 1902-2). This is my first experience with Lenovo. Lenovo mobile and Lenovo customer support service is very very bed. I used Lenovo k8 plus last 3 month in these months the mobile become in very bed condition...the battery is not working full day after full charge.. the display of this phon is also very low quality..my Lenovo k8 plus mobile is in very bad (pathetic). No any service support also available from Lenovo. Even no one is ready to buy it in half price.this the condition of Lenovo.. very bed (pathetic) experience with Lenovo..

0,"Its, good but I am not available to understand how works dual camera because I checked by finger touch on camera, but I think uper camera is not working. So we how to say dual camera phone. Other wise its ok"
0,Nice lenovo
0,"Nothing extraordinary to call it a killer note. Camera which lenovo has boasted of, is poor like all previous lenovo phones, The dual camera setup is just a gimmick and takes ordinary quality photos. Dolby atmos sound output is of average quality, it was better on earlier lenovo's. The headset volume while on call is very low compared to previous lenovo's, redmi & mi, samsung's. Making K8 note pure android experience, lenovo has robbed users of some good features available on the previous lenovo's. Hence the software is a big let down, lenovo should have stripped down the vibe UI to near stock experience instead of dumping it. Also, a phone cant be called a killer if it doesnt have the basic function of backlit keys at the bottom. Software experience is not smooth as it should be considering the ram and motherboard and coupled with stock android.In my opinion, K8 note is nothing of what it was projected to be and the previous lenovo's were slightly better minus the full hd displays on them."
0,Product is very nice butCash back offer is fake no any cash back creditOffer ke nam per frod karte he
0,Amazon and lenovo is cheating customers. only one sim support 4 g network. I am using Airtel and Jio sim when I use Airtel for data then Jio sim lost his network because it support only 4g

0,"Let me start with the Cons firstCons :1) GPS tracking is incorrect. If you use any activity tracking app for running, walking etc then get ready to see incorrect readings2) Dual camera setup is a total gimmick feature. Though primary 13MP is good.3) The front camera has some filter mode enabled by default which produces grainy pics. Pro cam mode is better.4) Phone heats up sometimes unnecessarily though not a big con.5) Headphone/Earphone volume output less6) Dolby Atmos is a big failure. It actually lowers the sound output.7) No backlit illuminated navigation buttons. Get's tough in dark.Pro1) Excellent power output.2) Sound output good3) Good Voice clarity4) All features rather than the cons work perfectly.VerdictFine for the price it is offered for but the phone doesn't live up to the mark as compared to the publicity/marketing Lenovo did for this product isn't."
0,"Hello,The phone starts resetting itself randomly. This issue starts after after 3 days of use, especially when you use it for longer time like watching a you tube video for an hour or two. The issue starts to repeat after 1 or 2 days, then I tried few option mentioned in Lenovo help APP which is pre-installed(I am feeling like a stupid for having done this) , after that for 4 or 5 days it didn't show this issue. Now it back with a bang and almost resets itself every night. Use the phone in night, then lock it and keep aside and when you take the phone again in the morning, boom, it is dead already. And when you manually power-on there is enough juice left in the battery. Not sure what to do with this kind of issue, the phone is absolutely useless.When I approached amazon for return, they are quoting policy and suggest me that I should run pillar to post to get problem rectified (not sure even it is rectifiable issue), The below Amazon's tagline tag-line sounds funny"" Earth's Most Customer-Centric Company."", I am not really sure whether they understood what they really mean, I am already started feeling bitter for my purchase decision in Amazon and now I realized that buying Lenovo brand is same as throwing your money into garbage."

After six month mobile stopped working while it was charging but centre asking for repair of this mobile @Rs.12000/- as they opened the phone at the centre without our presence and they told us that it has been damaged duty to water. But I m 100% sure this is false and fabricated and centre making money by levelling anything whatever they want by any means to make money. This is harassment of customers of Amazon and in future I will not by electronics gazzets through Amazon in fact now I will prefer to buy physically through store so that they will repair it. All online buyers getting harassed by these service centre.

But still it(k8 note) doesn't have functionality which k6 power already has.Functions which is not in k8 note are as follows:1) Wide touch(to lock phone, shortcut for many recent app, its just like apple button)2) quick snap (double tap volume button to take screen shot)3) smart scene (to open any action by time or by on connecting any device like wifi etc, by this function you can set your brightness low for night time by set action time 8:00 pm - 7:00 am, or silent your phone between office hours automatically many other things)4) fingerprint snap: you can take photos by touching fingerprint sensor)5)dual app profile: (two WhatsApp/fb account simultaneously)6) quick flashlight: (by tapping home button twice)7) secure zone, guest mode: (in secure zone you can install same apps with different account and that apps can only work when you open secure zone with password)"

No proper responce after multiple complaints.No headset in boxpros:Good sounddisplay is much better than other phones in this price rangeBattery Backup is goodBody finishing is betterOverall good phone if there is no network issue. I strongly suggest not to buy it through amazon or anyother marketplace. Visit physical store so that you can check the phone at the time of buying.
0,Very good Android
0,I am a regular customer of amazon as well as lenovo mobiles. All my previous lenovo mobiles were fine without any problem but this mobile is a disppointment because audio is very poor in the sense I am virtually unable to hear other people speak to me eventhough I have kept the call volume at the maximum. Never ever thought that lenovo and amazon would ditch me like this. I cant go in for a replacement also as I threw away the original packing and the Invoice as I was confident that this mobile also will be as good as my earlier lenovo mobiles.

That's a bad reviews by of mi note 4Front camera-k8 front camera is best then mi,Back camera- booth looks same.Display resulation and quality of display- k8 is good,If you talk about design k8 is better then mi but waight is more.Flashlight- mi back flash is good then k8, but front flash is good k8, it looks like Sony front camera.K8 is splash proof and gorilla Glass that's better then mi,When I using video calling front flash is not on means front flash option is not given on k8.After all things finally I gives 3* from k8 and 2* from mi......

Fingerprint works smooth and fast, speakers are awesome, Dolby sound is a plus, 4 GB ram makes it super smooth and fast,screen display is perfect with actual colors, go for it at rs 12,000/- (discount price). Time to se how long it lasts."

1,"It's very nice K8(4GB, 64GB) mobile, all features are awesome. I have received it on 14.09.17 as promised. Only the issue of battery life is matter of concern. Today Updated by Lenovo regarding these issues, let's see. But overall good choice."
